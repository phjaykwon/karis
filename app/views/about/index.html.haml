		Our Story
	.subtitle
		Karis was started out with a simple idea of making music more accessible to all.

	.description
		We saw that there wasnâ€™t a website where someone anywhere around the world could search for their favorite song in any language. However, we want Karis to be more than just a database of songs. We want to build a community of music lovers. 
		%br
		Our ultimate goal is to support talented, unknown artists by both raising funds and awareness.
